The files in this directory are used to setup a test server (called localhost)
to simulate the firewalls managed by Firelet.
It is supposed to be used only for testing - by running Firelet on the same host.

The hosts will run an alias on its network interface for each firewall configured
in Firelet.
An SSH daemon will listen on all those interfaces.

When Firelet sets up an SSH connection to a firewall using the "firelet" user, it
will simply reach an IP alias on localhost.
Having a firelet user with a special .bashrc file, localhost will emulate the
interaction with "ip addr show" and the other commands, faking the behavior of a
real firewall.

Usage: create a "firelet" user and run setup_emulator.sh

Monitor the emulator log file using:
tail -f /home/firelet/firelet_ne.log
